After creating an account with [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/app/4namc6eb3z) and staking 3500 EURO worth of CRO, I started gaining 3% cashback on each payment with the Visa Card they provided.

crypto.com never said anything about a limit on the amount of cashback you can earn.

After earning around 1000 USD in cashback in around a month, they canceled my cashback for all future payments.
This is not in their guidelines and support doesn't want to clarify which are the limits for cashback.

They only said there is a formula that calculates a limit based on the amount you spend. Isn't it 3% of the amount spent with the Indigo Blue card?

Here are some of the explanations they gave me:

[crypto.com](https://crypto.com/app/4namc6eb3z) account still offers a lot of benefits, 10% interest on CRO, 12% interest on USDC, and maybe more cashback starting next month. But everyone should know **there is a limit to the amount of cashback you can earn**, even if they don't publish it.
