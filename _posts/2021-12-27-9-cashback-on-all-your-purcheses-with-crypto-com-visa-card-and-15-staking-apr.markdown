Recently I created an account with [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/app/4namc6eb3z) for crypto investments and their Visa Card.

You will have 30 days after registration to buy crypto assets with [0 commission](https://crypto.com/app/4namc6eb3z) and you can choose from many crypto assets such as Bitcoin ($BTC), Ethereum ($ETH), Binance Coin ($BNB), Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche, and many more.

One of the best features you can find on [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/app/4namc6eb3z) is staking. You can invest your crypto for 1-12% APR (annual percentage rate). What bank gives you that?

Besides staking you can also get a free Visa card (both physical and virtual) and receive cashback for all purchases made in all stores where you pay with FIAT (EURO, USD, or local currency). You get 1% cashback on all transactions, but if you stake CRO, crypto.com's digital currency, for six months you will get up to 8% cashback (paid in CRO) on all purchases.

Staking CRO also gets you up to 10% APR on the amount.

What can be better than getting up to 8% back on all your expenses? It means you live one month every year for free, right? And what if the CRO coin doubles or triples its price meanwhile? Even better!

You can even use their Visa card to pay with local currencies. For example, I top-up EURO and use it to pay with RON (local currency). 

Another way to benefit even more from their card is to add it to your [Curve app](https://www.curve.com/join#DWGL8P6E) and receive 1% CURVE cashback as well on top of CRYPTO.com's cashback. That adds up to 9% cashback. You can also get a 5 USD reward if you sign up for [Curve](https://www.curve.com/join#DWGL8P6E).

Update: You don't receive cashback on B2B platforms (like namecheap.com or stocks investments). Pay your groceries, your gifts, and personal items and you will benefit from the rewards after each transaction in a matter of seconds.
